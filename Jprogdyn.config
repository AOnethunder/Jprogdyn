### Jprogdyn Configuration File ###

# This file controls the behavior of Jprogdyn.
# By default, Jprogdyn will use "Jprogdyn.conf" as the current configuration file.
#
# To switch to a custom file:
# mvn exec:java -Dconfig.filename="another.config"

# Blank lines and comments starting with # are ignored.
# Comments may be placed after any configuration value with a #.
# All options must be specified on one line.
